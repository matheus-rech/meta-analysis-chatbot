## Prompt:

## Response:
Great! Conducting a network meta-analysis (NMA) can be a comprehensive way to compare multiple treatments or interventions across different studies. Here are the general steps:

1. **Initialize the Meta-Analysis Session**: Set up a new session for your NMA.
2. **Upload Study Data**: Provide the data that includes the studies, treatments, and outcomes.
3. **Perform the Network Meta-Analysis**: Execute the NMA to compare the different treatments.
4. **Generate Visualizations**: Create network plots and forest plots.
5. **Assess Consistency and Bias**: Check for consistency within the network and assess any potential publication bias.
6. **Generate a Report**: Compile the results into a comprehensive report.

Let's start by initializing the meta-analysis session. Could you provide the following details?
- Name of the project
- Type of study (e.g., clinical_trial, observational, diagnostic)
- Effect measure (e.g., OR, RR, MD, SMD, HR, PROP, MEAN)
- Analysis model (e.g., fixed, random, auto)
